# Health-project-sta302
This is a linear regression group project to assess how How do economic factors (GDP, health expenditure) and social factors (education, BMI, country status) influence life expectancy.

# Dataset description

The dataset used in this analysis is the "Life Expectancy Data," sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations. It contains country-level health and economic indicators from multiple years, providing insights into the determinants of life expectancy across different nations. The original curators collected the data through government health reports, national surveys, and international economic databases. WHO compiled health-related statistics such as life expectancy, BMI, and healthcare expenditures, while GDP and education levels were gathered from World Bank reports and national census records.
The response variable in this study is Life Expectancy (years), which is a continuous variable representing the average number of years a newborn is expected to live under current mortality conditions. Life expectancy is well-suited for a linear model as it is a continuous variable with no extreme skewness, and the relationships between predictors and life expectancy are expected to be approximately linearly based on previous research.

## Interpretation:
* Countries whose Status is categorized as "Developed" typically have higher schooling years, GDP, and healthcare expenditures, which are expected to positively correlate with life expectancy.
* Total Expenditure (health spending) is hypothesized to increase longevity, particularly in developing countries where resources are constrained.
* GDP is expected to have a strong positive effect, as wealthier countries tend to have better healthcare and living conditions.
* Schooling is a key predictor, as higher education levels often correlate with better health awareness and access to care.
* BMI presents an interesting relationship; moderate BMI levels may indicate better nutrition, but extreme values (underweight/obesity) could negatively affect life expectancy.
